      ingredients: [
        '1 lb Pork sausage or Ground Beef',
        '8 Tortillas',
        '2 cups Cheddar Cheese, grated',
        '1/2 Onion',
        '1 Green Pepper',
        '1 Can Tomato Sauce',
        '1 tbsp Refined Coconut Oil (optional)',
        '1 tbsp Basil',
        '1 tsp Oregano',
        '1 tsp Onion Granules',
        '1 tsp Garlic Granules',
        'Salt to Taste',

      directions: [
        'Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Cut up the half onion, pepper and pepperoni.',
        'Next let’s get the filling ready. Brown some ground beef or sausage in a skillet. If you’d like you can reserve a little of this in a bowl as a topping. Add the tomato sauce to the skillet along with the spices. No need to cook for long … the flavors will combine nicely in the oven. Just make sure the sauce is reasonably thick. And if you’re meat is lean as mine was add a tablespoon of refined coconut oil. Always looking for ways to sneak a little in ;-).',
        'Put a little meat sauce and grated cheese on a tortilla as shown in the picture. Then roll it up and place it against the side of the pan. Keep going till you’ve a) used up all the tortillas, b) run out of sauce, c) run out of pan space.',
        'Now we’re ready for the fun part! Spread the remaining cheese over the top. Then place your toppings. You can use whatever toppings your family likes. The ones in the ingredient list are my family’s favorites. Pop the dish in the oven for 20 minutes. The first time you make this keep an eye on it since oven temperatures vary. We’re shooting for a crisp tortilla … hotter makes this happen.',
